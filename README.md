This is a from-scratch implementation of the well known constellation effect with some rainbow effects and the HTML5 canvas tag :rainbow:!

### Credits
I've created this project based on a [video by Franks Laboratory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yvz_axxWG4Y). I really love this effect and wanted to build it from scratch without any external libraries.
